            When looking at college admissions sites you will often see things like SAT requirements, ACT requirements, or AP credits. If you don't know what those are, or if you want to know the details, this page is for you. It goes into full depth of the registration process, costs, and dates for the ACT, SAT, and AP exams. We will also cover how taking the exams contribute to your university application, and what each exam really is.

                    The SAT, or the Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a standardized test managed by the college board. The test is taken by many students each year to show post-secondary institutions their ability in critical reading, math and writing and is mostly multiple choice. The test is about 3 hours long with long individual sections.
                </div> 

                <div class="tests-sat-i-c">
                    <p>
                        There are four main sections in the SAT, though there used to be a fourth optional essay writing section that the college board has removed. The college board has also gotten rid of SAT subject tests in place of AP exams. So, the first section in the SAT is the Critical reading section which is 65 minutes long, has 52 questions. This part of the test evaluates your ability to carefully read and understand college level texts. Here, you read 5 passages which cover a variety of topics like science, literature, history, etc.. There will  be a paired passage where you will analyse and answer questions about two passages that cover the same topic. Another part of this section to look out for are the graphs since you will be understanding the data in the graph and using that to support the argument of the passage.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        After the critical reading section is the writing section which consists of 44 questions, 4 passages and is 35 minutes long. It covers similar subjects as the reading section. However, instead of reading the passage, you actively go through it and do editing to improve flow of thought, make the text make more sense, and change sentences to better communicate an idea.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After reading and writing comes the math sections; a no calculator section and a calculator allowed. In both sections you will cover many topics in math like trigonometry, algebra, geometry and functions. The no calculator section is 20 questions and is 25 minutes long and a calculator is not permitted nor necessary to answer the questions. Out of the 20 quesitons, the last 5 are student response questions, meaning you write down your own answer. This doesn't mean that you have to show your work, you just have to write the number yourself instead of choosing one out of 4 choices.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The final section of the test is the calculator allowed section. Here you are allowed to use a calculator. There are 38 questions and you are permitted 55 minutes to complete the section. Similar to the no calculator section, the last 7 quesitons will be free response, where you will have to fill out the answer yourself.

                        To register for the SAT, you first create an account on the college board website or click <a href="https://account.collegeboard.org/login/signUp?appId=319&DURL=https%3A%2F%2Fcollegereadiness.collegeboard.org%2Fsat%2Fregister%2Finternational%2Ffees" target="_blank">here</a>.                
                        After you have created and account, click on your name at the top on the college board site and go to the 
                        <a href="https://mysat.collegeboard.org/dashboard" target="_blank">My SAT dashboard</a>, which should look like this:

                        </figure>
                        Once you're here you click on the "Register for the SAT" button. The next few pages will ask you to fill  out information about what clubs you attend, what courses you have taken, and what AP exams you have taken. It will also ask you demographic related questions like gender, race, and religious affiliation. After this comes the registration menus where you will select test center (you can find the list of available test centers near you, <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/find-test-centers">here</a>). Then comes the last step where you pay for the test registration and upload a photo and looks like how you will look on test day. You only get 20 minutes for the last step, so keep a photo ready that shows your face and shoulders clearly. The base cost for applying in Canada is $98 USD, there are additional costs like changing the test center which is and additional $25 USD or Cancelling which also costs $25 (the rest is refunded). 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Once you complete the payment, your My SAT dashboard will show a card with your upcoming tests.

                        </figure>
                        The card shows information about the registration status, date of test, address of test center. Below the information there is an action button. This is to cancel your test, change test center, and print out an admission ticket, which is like your passport to the test center.

                        Throughout the year there are certain dates to keep track of if you do wish to register for the SAT. In Canada there are usually 5 test dates during the school year; one in August, one in October, one in December, one in March and one in May. The registration deadline for all of these is roughly one month before the test date. For specific dates and deadlines for Canadian regestration, click <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/international">here.</a> If you cannot meet any of the dates in Canada, there are a lot more available dates for testing in the US. In the US there are additional dates in November, May, and June. And after taking the test there is a one month gap between test day and results coming out. So keep this in mind for when you register for a date and want to send in scores.
