                When looking at college admissions sites you will often see things like SAT requirements, ACT requirements, or AP credits. If you don't know 
                what those are, or if you want to know the details, you will find what you need here. It goes into full depth of the registration process, 
                costs, and dates for the ACT, SAT, and AP exams. We will also cover how taking the exams contribute to your university application, and what 
                each exam really is.

                    The ACT is another standardized test managed by ACT inc. This test covers 5 core subjects, English, math, reading, science, and an 
                    optional writing section; the test is scored on a range of 1-36. This is also taken by highschool students in grades 11 and 12 to send in 
                    to colleges during applications to substitute for a poor GPA or to stand out compared to other students and to show proficiency in college 
                    level material. The test is 2 hours 55 minutes long and 3 hours and 35 minutes if the student does the optional essay writing section. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    The English section is 45 minutes long, and has 75 4-choice mcq's. It covers  topics like grammar & usage, punctuation, sentence structure, 
                    strategy, organization, and style.  The math section is 60 minutes long and has 60 five-choice mcq's. This part of the test covers topics 
                    like pre-algebra, elementary algebra, intermediate algebra, coordinate geometry, plane geometry, and trigonometry. Then there is the 
                    reading section which is 35 minutes long, and has 40, four-choice mcq's. Here you wil be tested on your reading comprehension of what is 
                    directly stated or implied. Then there is the final section, science. This section has 40, four-choice mcq's, and this part covers your 
                    interpretation, analysis, evaluation, reasoning, and problem solving skills. The optional writing section is that you have to write an 
                    essay in 40 minutes. 
                </p>

                <p>
                   The ACT is written similarly to the SAT, meaning you do one section at a time. It as if you are doing 4 separate tests, so you cannot look 
                   back at completed sections if you finish one early.

                </h3>

                <p>
                    To sign up for the ACT, you will need to visit the <a href="https://my.act.org/">ACT</a> website. Once the site is open, create an ACT 
                    account; here it will just ask for personal information like name and address. After you enter this information, the site will prompt you 
                    to select whether or not you want add the writing section which is adds to the cost of registering for the test. The base cost for 
                    registering is $60.00 USD and an additional $25 for the writing section.  
                </p>

                <p>
                    Another cost of the ACT is a test-option change where you can change from no writing to writing included, which is $25 USD. Though, this 
                    cost can be refunded if you decide to remove the writing section or are absent on test day. A late registration costs $36, and an extra 
                    late registration called standby testing costs $57. Standby testing provides a student the opportunity to register after the late deadline 
                    however the test spot is not guaranteed. Sending extra scores to colleges costs $16, and a question service costs $30. The test service is 
                    where you are sent the test and what you put as the answers after you write the test.

                    The SAT, or the Scholastic Aptitude Test, is a standardized test managed by the college board. The test is taken by many students each year to show post-secondary institutions their ability in critical reading, math and writing and is mostly multiple choice. The test is about 3 hours long with long individual sections. Each section is timed and you are only allowed to do that section, meaning if you complete one part early you cannot look at a previously completed section. Test scores range from 400-1600. With 800 coming from your math sections, and the other 800 coming from reading and writing.
                </p>

            <div class="test-i-content">
                <h3>
                    Content
                </h3>

                <p>
                    There are four main sections in the SAT (you fill out answers for each section through an answer sheet where you fill out bubbles), though 
                    there used to be a fourth optional essay writing section that the college board has removed. The college board has also gotten rid of SAT 
                    subject tests in place of AP exams.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    So, the first section in the SAT is the Critical reading section which is 65 minutes long, has 52 questions. This part of the test 
                    evaluates your ability to carefully read and understand college level texts. Here, you read 5 passages which cover a variety of topics like 
                    science, literature, history, etc.. There will  be a paired passage where you will analyse and answer questions about two passages that 
                    cover the same topic. Another part of this section to look out for are the graphs since you will be understanding the data in the graph and 
                    using that to support the argument of the passage.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    After the critical reading section is the writing section which consists of 44 questions, 4 passages and is 35 minutes long. It covers 
                    similar subjects as the reading section. However, instead of reading the passage, you actively go through it and do editing to improve flow 
                    of thought, make the text make more sense, and change sentences to better communicate an idea.
                </p>

                <p>
                    After reading and writing comes the math sections; a no calculator section and a calculator allowed. In both sections you will cover many 
                    topics in math like trigonometry, algebra, geometry and functions. The no calculator section is 20 questions and is 25 minutes long and a 
                    calculator is not permitted nor necessary to answer the questions. Out of the 20 questions, the last 5 are student response questions, 
                    meaning you write down your own answer. This doesn't mean that you have to show your work, you just have to write the number yourself 
                    instead of choosing one out of 4 choices.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The final section of the test is the calculator allowed section. Here you are allowed to use a calculator. There are 38 questions and you 
                    are permitted 55 minutes to complete the section. Similar to the no calculator section, the last 7 questions will be free response, where 
                    you will have to fill out the answer yourself.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Do remember that a wrong answer on the test does not lose you points. So, it is always better to try every question even if you have to 
                    guess some because even if you guess the answer there is a 1/4 you will get the answer right.

                    Once you're here you click on the "Register for the SAT" button. The next few pages will ask you to fill  out information about what clubs 
                    you attend, what courses you have taken, and what AP exams you have taken. It will also ask you demographic related questions like gender, 
                    race, and religious affiliation. After this comes the registration menus where you will select test center (you can find the list of 
                    available test centers near you, <a href="https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/find-test-centers">here</a>). Then comes 
                    the last step where you pay for the test registration and upload a photo and looks like how you will look on test day. You only get 20 
                    minutes for the last step, so keep a photo ready that shows your face and shoulders clearly. The base cost for applying in Canada is $98 
                    USD, there are additional costs like changing the test center which is and additional $25 USD or Cancelling which also costs $25 (the rest

                <p>
                    Throughout the year there are certain dates to keep track of if you do wish to register for the SAT. In Canada there are usually 5 test 
                    dates during the school year; one in August, one in October, one in December, one in March and one in May. The registration deadline for 
                    all of these is roughly one month before the test date. For specific dates and deadlines for Canadian registration, click <a href="https://
                    collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/international">here.</a> If you cannot meet any of the dates in Canada, there are a lot more 
                    available dates for testing in the US. In the US there are additional dates in November, May, and June. And after taking the test there is 
                    a one month gap between test day and results coming out. So keep this in mind for when you register for a date and want to send in scores.

                <p>
                    AP exams are another set of exams that are managed by the college board, and are scored on a scale from 1-5 with a score of 3 being a
                     passing mark. The key difference between this set of tests and The SAT is that AP exams are not one test, they are a set of tests that 
                     assess your ability in various subjects at a university level. One thing to notice is that AP exams cover nearly 40 subjects (you can find 
                     the full list of available tests <a href="https://apstudents.collegeboard.org/course-index-page">here</a>) so you can get an AP credit in 
                     almost any subject you want. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are some subjects without and exam, or some that need extra material like a portfolio. These include but are not limited to AP 
                    Capstone Diploma, AP research, and AP seminar. AP exams also have the benefit of earning you university credit in high school; however, 
                    different schools require different minimum scores to earn credit. For example, some schools will require a 5, whereas some require a 3. 
                    For more detail for the AP credit that you can earn at your school search, "<i>school name</i> ap credit policy."
                </p>

                <p>
                    Though all AP exams are slightly different, they do have some similarities. Most of them are 2-3 hours long and have a multiple choice 
                    section. There are some AP exams where the multiple choice has multiple answers like AP physics algebra based and AP computer science 
                    principles. In these you only get marks for these questions if you select both. Some exams also have a free response section where you show 
                    your work and write in your answer. Exams like AP Calculus AB have both of these section where the mcq's(multiple choice questions) are 
                    worth half the exam and the other half of your marks come from the free response section. Though most exams are paper and pencil, the 
                    courses mentioned above are not and AP chinese and Japanese are done through a computer in school.

                <p>
                    The process for registering for an AP exam is different from applying for the SAT. Since getting an AP credit requires you to complete an 
                    AP course you need to complete the course at school; this is similar to doing and enhanced course, or an honors course. However, some 
                    schools don't offer AP courses. Instead, they host the exam and students take them through the school. Because of this you will have to 
                    register for an exam through your school. For more information contact your school's guidance counselor. Once you've registered, you will 
                    need to get a class code for your ap course from your school and sign into the My AP dashboard which can be found at the same spot as the 
                    My SAT dashboard.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    Once you are at the dashboard, there will be cards similar to those in the My SAT dashboard. These tell you the AP course you took, the exam date, and other important dates`. You can then click on the card to see the dashboard of the specific course. Here you are provided with skills and topics learnt in the selected Course, links to submit materials for your portfolio and video resources to learn and review topics.

                </p>

                <p>
                    You will be taking ap exams in your school that you are registering at. However, if there are some exceptions, the college board or your 
                    school will email you further instructions.

                    Important Dates and Deadlines
                </h3>

                <p>
                    The sign up deadline for AP exams is usually early in the school year, for a specific date you will need to talk you your guidance 
                    counselor. All exams are taken during a two week period at your school in person. For the 2021 - 2022 school year, the exams are taken 
                    during the weeks of May 2-6 and May 9-13.

                    The college board has multiple dates and times for each exam, but your school will decide on one of them for their students to take. For a 
                    full list of the times for the year, click <a href="https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/exam-administration-ordering-scores/
                    exam-dates">here</a>. Also courses that require portfolios have due dates separate to the exam dates. For AP Art and Design, you have to 
                    submit it to your AP teacher/coordinator, and they have to submit it to the College Board by the first week of May. For AP Seminar, 
                    Research, and Computer Science Principles, you need to submit by May 2 11:59 PM. For the seminar and research courses you need to submit 
                    the required material to your coordinator. But, for Computer Science Principles you submit your materials on the College Board Site.
